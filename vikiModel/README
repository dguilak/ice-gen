All of the modules in subIh/ have been generated by parsing out subroutines from ice-Ih-gen.f and compiling them using f2py. ice-I?-gen.f has been authored by Viki Buch.

To use in python:

import subIh.<method_name>

Then it can be called by using subIh.<method_name>.

If you want to import everything from subIh, use the following:

from subIh import *

Then you will be able to reference the modules without the subIh prefix (what is included in * is defined in __init__.py at the top level of the directory).
